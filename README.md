Dear reviewer, thank you for taking the time to review my project. 

In this project, I pratice SOLID Design Principle with Modular Design to achieve Clean iOS Architecture. The project is covered by Unit, Integration, and End-to-End Testing Strategies with TDD (Test-driven development) approach. I separated my project in 2 schemes because I want to business logic platform agnostic and I want to run the tests in a macOS target to get fast and reliable feedback. Platfrom specific components get tested in a different scheme. This pattern allows that business logic can also be deployed in different platforms like macOS and iOS like in this project.
